This is a pilot application to check whether a given text is valid or not depending on some criteria. The application is constructed with React 18 and the repo is hosted on GitHub. The functionality which is checking the given text is made possible with Regex.

When a text is entered in the area, our Regex function is checking whether it's valid or not depending on the included characters. If the text is longer than the given parameter of length, it's automatically invalid. Also, any text including whitespace or newline is also counted as invalid. In order to pass a valid text to the area, be sure that your text consists of small letters, capital letters, numbers and/or some special characters such as !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~. The text entered will be rendered right below the area in order for you to see wheter it's working as well as with a label in order to specify validity.

In order to run this application, first you need to install all the dependencies with 'npm install' command in the terminal. When installed, you can again go to the terminal and enter 'npm run start'. When ready, a new tab with the application will be opened in your browser.
